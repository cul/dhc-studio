In 2013, the Columbia University Libraries’ [Digital Humanities
Center](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dhc.html), along
with the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Teaching
Center](http://teachingcenter.wikischolars.columbia.edu/), established
“Studio@Butler,” which they described as a space “[designed to support emerging
practices in pedagogy and digital
scholarship](https://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2013/2013-9-11_Studio_Butler_Opens.html).” 

A lot has changed in five years, with the continued growth of digital,
data-driven research across disciplines as one exponent of that change. The
Studio has grown and changed as well, as it fell under the purview of [Digital
Scholarship](https://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship/).
Programming has included the 2017 [Puerto Rico
Mapathon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/nyregion/maps-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria.html),
where the Studio was too small to hold the 25 librarians helping over 60
volunteers to improve maps of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
In addition, the Studio has hosted a Friday afternoon Open Lab, where the
[Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research at Columbia
University](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in) has traditionally gathered, that has
generated innovative digital, data-driven research. Finally, through its
invited talks and general welcoming ethos, the Studio has welcomed researchers
from universities around the world to discuss their work. 

In 2018, it became increasingly clear that the Studio was not just an
experimental space but a space central to Columbia University Libraries’ core [strategic
directions](https://strategicdirections.library.columbia.edu/). The
ahierarchical structure of the Open Lab aims to foster inclusion as a founding
principle, making use of that inclusion to inspire inquiry, catalyze
discovery, and advance knowledge. Through its work looking outward to the
world beyond Columbia’s walls, the Studio has empowered staff and helped shape
discourse around pressing issues.

This alignment of values implied that others within the Libraries were doing similar
work in fostering digital, data-driven research and pedagogy that was
simultaneously ethical, sustainable, and collaborative. And so, the Studio is
now growing with its first sibling Studio, the space maintained by [Research
Data
Services](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html),
which has been running its own Open Labs four times a week with nearly
identical commitments. As such the Studio now spans two Libraries divisions, Digital
Scholarship and the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Libraries.

The Studio, then, is both a space and a practice. A space for innovative
scholarly work done within a practice of inclusion. But just as the practice
is built from several core principles, the space is also built from more than
one site. Studio Lehman now joins Studio Butler, sharing programming,
principles, and this very webpage.

With this webpage, we hope that it grows alongside the Studio. In addition to
the information about programming included in the earlier version of the site,
this new one will also include programming at Studio Lehman alongside
programming of note outside of the Studio.

Furthermore, as the Studio is not just a space for programming but also a
practice, we will grow our library of tuition, creating workshops and
tutorials as well as sharing others we encounter. We find that scholars with
principles similar to ours are often left adrift by typical digital,
data-driven tuition, which can be narrowly tool- and results-oriented.
Instead, we foreground ethical, sustainable, and collaborative digital,
data-driven research and pedagogy.

The new year 2019 promises great things, and we hope you’ll join us for them.
