A new year brings a new semester, which also means new events at [Studio at
Butler]({{ site.baseurl }}/spaces/butler). This semester, we will continue to
offer an [Open Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab.html) every Friday, 3â€“5pm.

Additionally, Studio at Butler is introducing Open Labs on Mondays, as well,
beginning February 4. Facilitated by Digital Publishing Librarian Michelle
Wilson and Assistant Director of Scholarly Communication and Projects Nicky
Agate, these Open Labs will be focused on academic publishing and scholarly
communication.

In late March, Digital Scholarship Librarian Alex Gil and
GIS/Metadata Librarian Eric Glass will be leading a four-part mini-course on
the geographical representation of bibliographical data. Stay tuned for a more
in-depth description of the four sessions in the upcoming weeks.

Studio at Butler will also continue its tradition of being a digital
laboratory attached to a seminar or a collaborative space for regular,
scheduled use. This semester, Studio at Butler will be used by Professor [Pamela
Smith](https://history.columbia.edu/faculty/smith-pamela-h/), Associate
Professor [Dennis Tenen](https://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/453), the
[Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu), and the
[FAB-Musiconis project](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/musiconis/) under the
direction of Professor [Susan
Boynton](https://music.columbia.edu/bios/susan-boynton).

Finally, we hope to finalize our guest speaker schedule and make an
announcement soon about bringing some exciting voices in cultural analytics,
experimental and mobilized humanities, social justice, and more.
