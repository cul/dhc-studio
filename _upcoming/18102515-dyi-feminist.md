In times of uncertainty and a marked increase in attacks against academics and activists, we should prepare for contingencies. In this tutorial we will go over the recommendations of the [DIY Guide to Feminist Cybersecurity](https://hackblossom.org/cybersecurity/). You will learn some basic techniques on: how to protect your data, protect yourself from hacking, what it means to remain truly anonymous, how to do it and more. The session will be followed by a Q&A discussion to address individual concerns.
