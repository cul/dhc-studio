MiKTeX, like [TeX Live]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/tex-live/), combines the various bits and pieces of
the TeX document preparation system into one, large distribution that is
easier to maintain. Unlike TeX Live, which is updated once a year, MiKTeX is
updated on a rolling basis, as it is maintained by one person, instead of by a
team of testers. Furthermore, its initial installation footprint is
considerably smaller than TeX Liveâ€™s. We recommend using MiKTeX in Windows
environments.
