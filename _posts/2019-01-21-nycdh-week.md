As it has for every year since [NYCDH Week](http://dhweek.nycdh.org) began,
the Studio is hosting workshops among the myriad opportunities to learn more
about digital humanities around New York.

This year, we’re taking advantage of the new Studio, Studio at Lehman, to push
our number of workshops to the limit. The Studio will be hosting all seven
Columbia-related workshops, and we invite you to come participate in as many
as you like. Specific information and RSVP links are available in the sidebar,
but below, we’ll describe each workshop in a bit of detail.

All of the workshops are for beginners except for one, and you should bring a
laptop to the workshops if possible.

**Introduction to Jekyll:** Digital Scholarship Librarian and Studio founder
Alex Gil will be leading the first of two workshops Tuesday morning during
NYCDH Week. In this workshop he will offer an introduction to the static website generator
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is used to make fast, durable, loading webpages or projects. Jekyll has been used for many genres of academic work: digital editions, academic journals, digital archives of images and more. If you ever wanted to create a website that you control and design, this is the workshop for you.

**[Make a Simple Webmap with
Leaflet](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/make-a-simple-webmap-with-leaflet/):** Research Data Librarian Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira will lead an introduction to JavaScript by also showing how to use the
web-mapping library [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com). At the end of the
workshop, users will be able to embed maps in webpages using data they
provide.

**[Working with Open Data: Intro to
APIs](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/working-with-open-data-intro-to-apis-2/):**
There is so much data out on the web that knowing how to use APIs will let you
explore and collect that data in a reliable and efficient way. This workshop
will be taught by Amir Imani, a student at the Data Science Institute and a
grantee at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.

**[Advanced Topics in Word
Embeddings](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/advanced-topics-in-word-embeddings/):**
PhD Candidate Jonathan Reeve will lead a workshop on advanced topics in word
embeddings. Word embeddings are the hottest new technology in natural language
processing, and are used across linguistic computer science, from machine
translation to information extraction and computational literary analysis. We
will cover advanced topics in word embeddings, including: document similarity
analysis, nearest-neighbor analysis, training vector spaces, and
visualization. We will use literary texts as examples, but the methods are
applicable across disciplines, and participants are encouraged to bring their
own corpora to analyze. Python will be our workshop language, and we will use
the libraries [SpaCy](http://spacy.io),
[Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec), and
[Sense2Vec](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec).

Please bring a laptop on which you’ve installed the Python libraries SpaCy,
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/),
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), word2vec, and sense2vec, as well as the
`en_core_web_lg` language model. Check that you can load it successfully with
`spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')`. Refer to the SpaCy documentation for
instructions on installing the language model.

**[Simple-CV](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/simple-cv/):** NYCDH Week
coincides with the first week of the [Scholar.txt]({{ site.baseurl
}}/workshop/2019/01/04/write-in-plain-text-with-scholartxt-2019-01/) workshop
series, so the first workshop, on making an online and print CV from the same
plain text file, has been rolled into the NYCDH Week festivities. Moacir will
be leading this workshop.

**Introduction to GitHub:** 

In this workshop, Patrick Smyth will introduce Git and GitHub. Git, a distributed version control system, and GitHub, a service for storing code in the cloud, are frequently used together to preserve data, collaborate in teams, and discover tools and code written by others. This workshop will introduce you to Git's primary functionality, including tracking, altering, and sharing the history of a project, and will also discuss use cases for Git and GitHub that include managing CVs, notes, and course syllabuses.

**[Git and Atom](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/git-and-atom/):** Moacir closes
the Columbia NYCDH Week workshops with an introduction to
[Git](http://git-scm.org), teaching how to use Git to put your projects,
articles, and chapters under version control. Then, see how easy it is to
integrate Git with [Atom](http://atom.io), a hackable text editor.
