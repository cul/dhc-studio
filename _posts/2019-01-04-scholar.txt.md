CUL Studio’s 2019 workshops kick off with a four-session series,
“Scholar.txt.” Writing with plain text can make your research and scholarship
more available, sustainable, and ethical. Nevertheless, it goes against
inertial orthodoxy in terms of scholarly production, especially in the
humanities and social sciences.

Over the course of the four sessions, we will:

* Create a CV that becomes a webpage and well-formatted pdf with one command,
* Write a scholarly article using plain text and managing citations,
* Share and discuss our experiences with learning how to use plain text in a
  scholarly environment, and
* Contribute to the open pedagogy for plain text scholarship.

The sessions are independent and require no prior knowledge. They will include
introductions and/or make use of the following freely available software:

* [Atom](http://atom.io), a plain text editor
* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org), a universal document converter
* [Git](http://git-scm.com), a version control application
* [Zotero](http://zotero.org), a reference management application
* [TeX, LaTeX, and XeLaTeX](http://ctan.org), a suite of document typesetting
applications

The sessions will be lead by our research data librarian, Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira, with assistance from other members of the Studio community. Come join
us and learn to make your work available, sustainable, and ethical.
