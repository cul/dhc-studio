With a handful of episodes of [CUL Studio’s Studio Remote’s _The Rose Hall
Project_](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/2020/10/13/studio-remote-launch/)
done and archived on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/~FYAVAsJg3lgoA), it’s
time to start branching out with a second show on the Studio Remote channel.
To that end, on January 19, Research Data Librarian Moacir P. de Sá Pereira is
launching a new stream on Tuesdays, from 3:00pm to 5:00pm New York time, for
Studio Remote’s _Coding with the Dead_.

For years, Moacir has been working on a project that has gone through
various iterations and names. It has used various technologies and has been
used in classrooms at least two universities. Under the Studio Remote
banner, however, he will resuscitate the project, now called _Wandertext_, and
develop it anew (but better) on Twitch. 

What _Coding with the Dead_ sacrifices in banter and collegiality (Moacir will
typically be alone, possibly talking to himself) is countered by the increased
complexity and depth of _Wandertext_.  _The Rose Hall Project_ relies on a fixed
dataset from which it constructs visualizations for the public so that they
may better imagine the lives of the enslaved persons at the Rose Hall plantation
in Jamaica. _Wandertext_, however, is a project dedicated to _creating_
datasets, thereby providing a semantically rich catalog of places referred to
in various “texts” (understood broadly) that can then be cross-referenced with
each other. 

The general sketch of the first few months of _Coding with the Dead_ embodies
“[frontend first](https://frontendfirst.fm/)” and “[html
first](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)” and “[mobile
first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00)”
and “[testing first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)”
orientations. Though we already have a general sense of how the data model
will and should look (given the five years of inherited, legacy data), the
project will be built up in pieces, iteratively. This, hopefully, will ensure
quality/stability as well as provide a space for experimentation and
low-stakes erring.

Because Moacir is Moacir, however, the technologies involved will include:

* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for designing the UX
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the UX
* [Ember](http://emberjs.com) for providing the front end framework
* [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com) for testing
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) for enforcing consistent code style
* [Git](http://git-scm.com) for controlling versioning
* [ZenHub](http://zenhub.com) for managing the project
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) for webmapping
* [Vim](http://vim.org) for editing

Additionally, it’s likely that there will be excursions to TypeScript,
GraphQL, and animation. Furthermore, deciding on a backend design will
include investigating Google Cloud Platform and similar offerings.

See you next Tuesday (and on subsequent Tuesdays) on
[Twitch](http://twitch.tv/culstudio)!
