  Contribute to building a directory of technical tools for use in ethical pedagogy.

---

Join us on Wednesday, April 3rd from 2:00 â€“ 5:00pm at the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard (Milstein 103) in an edit-a-thon, where we will work with other university groups in the US to edit the [Ethical EdTech directory](http://ethicaledtech.info).

Educational technology often serves as the vanguard of profit-seeking entities who surveil students unable to opt out of software used in the classroom. We invite you to participate in improving the Ethical EdTech directory of educational tools that exist outside of the profit and surveillance nexus that characterises so much educational technology.

Schedule:

2:00: Videoconference introductions and edit-a-thon instruction
2:30: Edit
4:30: Closing discussion
Throughout: snacks
