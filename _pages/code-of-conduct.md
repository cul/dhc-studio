(Adapted from XPMethod’s [Lab Culture
Manifesto](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/lab-culture.html))

Working on ethical, sustainable, collaborative, and <abbr title="Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable" class="initialism">FAIR</abbr> digital, data-driven
research and pedagogy requires work. And so, we believe in presence. Regular
[Open Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab.html) are a key way to get involved and to stay in touch. Use the
time to work on your projects, learn new skills, share expertise, or just
catch up on our own work. Attendance carries no requirements.

### Modalities of Engagement

We would like to maintain a conscious and engaged environment during [Open
Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab.html), sensitive to the dynamics of power—gender, sexuality, class,
race—particularly as they manifest in spatial and temporal imbalances of
participation. With this goal in mind, we actively promote the following
practices:

1. **Architectures of power.** Be mindful of the room’s physical arrangement.
   At the beginning of [Open Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab.html), long tables can be broken down into
   smaller islands of activity. Locations of power, such as the lectern or the
   center of the room, should be systematically ceded and inverted.

2. **Economy of attention.** Think carefully of other people’s time. Yield the
   floor and delegate authority. Come to definite conclusions that let people
   know that you are done. Conversations should move to various islands.
   Structure and preparation is a sign of respect for your audience. Ask
   questions. Listen more than you speak.

3. **Polyglossia.** Help bring a multiplicity of voices into the space.
   Allowing other voices to be heard means also moderating one’s own. Be aware
   of the strength and the reach of your voice. Soliloquies should be
   punctured by moments of quietude and reflection, giving time and space to
   those hesitant to join in the discussion. Watch for cues of others trying
   to speak but being interrupted or denied the opportunity.

4. **Peer learning.** Avoid long explanations and pontificating. We want to
   facilitate peer learning. Allow others the opportunity to figure it out on
   their own.

5. **Ethics of shared labor.** Make labor visible. Keep a manifest of project
   work done, to the extent possible.  Be aware of credit hierarchies.
   Prioritize the exposure of junior colleagues. In public, credit the
   involved collectives and encourage others to read through the records
   carefully for granular attribution.
