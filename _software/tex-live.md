TeX Live combines all the various bits and pieces of the TeX document
preparation system into one, large ecosystem that is simpler to install and
maintain. It is battle-tested by a team of developers around the world,
meaning every yearâ€™s edition is reliable and stable. Though it is available
for Windows and Mac, we recommend using [MiKTeX]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/miktex/) on Windows
computers and [MacTeX]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/mactex/) on Macs.
