In these difficult times, we miss the social life that we fostered around our collaborative research and learning, especially every Friday from 3pm to 5pm at the Studio. Starting this summmer, as soon as we wrapped up our work building [a grass roots coallition](http://covidmakerresponse.com/) to provide our city with much needed PPE, we started to offer our support to faculty, students and colleagues again, as we all adjusted to our intensified virtual research and learning environments. As part of our renewed effort, we began to dream of new and creative programming that would be more appropriate to our new ways of working. Today The Studio is proud to announce the first of such initiatives: Studio Remote. 

Starting Friday, October 23rd, 2020, and continuing thereafter every Friday from 3PM to 5PM—on our old Open Lab hours—Moacir P de Sá Pereira and Alex Gil will be your hosts on Twitch as they stream original programming designed around specific projects and ideas. We invite students, faculty and colleagues from Columbia and around the world to join us as we build digital scholarship projects live, step-by-step. While we broadcast live, you will be welcome to ask us questions or offer us feedback on Twitch's comment section. If you miss us on Fridays, you can also catch us later on our YouTube channel. We hope that building these projects in the open and live might replicate how we critique, shape and implement digital scholarship ideas in real time when you're not watching. This shared space we hope will help those who are embarking on or have embarked on projects of their own, the DH-curious perhaps, and definitely those veterans who would like to join our conversation. 

Do not be surprised if we invite you to jump from the comments to our video stream! 


### Season 1: The Rose Hall Project

In Season 1 of Studio Remote, Moacir and Alex will work on the *Rose Hall Project* in collaboration with Prof. Celia E. Naylor, professor of Africana Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University. Rose Hall Plantation in Jamaica is one of its largest tourists attractions. Tours of the old plantation still revolve around the myth of the White Witch of Rose Hall. Not only is this story ahistorical, it obscures the lives of the enslaved who labored and lived in Rose Hall. In this project we set out to re-center the their lives and relationships with each other as best as we can departing from the flawed and dehumanizing historical record. The project will serve as a companion piece to Naylor's forthcoming volume on Rose Hall Plantation.

In this season you will learn about wireframes, the ember javascript framework, D3, and much more! Watch this space for episodes and links as our first season progresses. We look forward to seeing you on Fridays!
