Since the CUL Studio’s founding in 2013, its primary vehicle for engaging in
its mission has been the “Open Lab.” This continues to this day, as, between
CUL Studio Butler and CUL Studio Lehman, Open Labs constitute up to 18 hours
of programming a week. Nevertheless, the concept can be opaque and can
discourage new members from attending. What follows is a description of an
Open Lab in the form of a FAQ.

### Can I come to an Open Lab just because?

Of course! Open Labs are sites for ethical, sustainable, collaborative, and
FAIR digital, data-driven research and pedagogy. They are not courses or
workshops requiring pre-registration, though sometimes courses or workshops
happen during them. They are not opportunities to get support on a specific
software platform, though that happens as well. 

Open Labs are meant to be inclusive and welcoming, meaning the only
requirement is being willing to speak with one of the librarians who will
hopefully approach you at some point and ask what brought you there.

### But I can get help with software, right?

Open Labs aren’t support desks; rather, they’re spaces where people can work
together to answer research questions. With digital, data-driven research,
that often requires wrestling with software. Both studios have librarians who
can give some guidance on a wide array of digital, data-driven research
questions. CUL Studio Lehman, furthermore, staffs its Open Lab with librarians
and interns from [Research Data
Services](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html),
who have specific technical knowledge. You can see their specific hours on the
[CUL Studio Lehman Open Lab Walk-in
Schedule](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/schedule.html).

Ideally, you will come with a specific question and stay because the
environment is welcoming, eventually joining a community and crafting
collaborative work with your peers.

### Can I come even though I’ve never coded in my life?

The requirements for being coming to Open Lab are more related to attitude
than to skill, so beginners are always welcome. As this site matures, we hope
it will include more in the way of on-boarding for future beginners. That is,
we hope to provide something like a guide for getting more involved in the
life of CUL Studio. 

But it must be underscored: Open Labs are not places to “learn Python.” They
are about learning a practice for digital, data-driven research. Python, the
programming language, may play a role in any given project (including your
own), but it just as easily may not. For those interested in “learning Python”
(or “learning R”), we point you, instead, to courses your
department might offer; to the Computer Science Department’s
[Computing in Context (COMS
W1002)](http://bulletin.columbia.edu/search/?P=%22Computing%20in%20Context%22)
course, which uses Python to introduce computing concepts to undergraduates
and graduate students; and, finally, to the workshops and boot camps
hosted by [Foundations for Research
Computing](http://rcfoundations.research.columbia.edu).
