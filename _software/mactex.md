MacTeX is a MacOS-specific implementation of [TeX Live]({{ "/software/tex-live/" | relative_url }}), a
single-stop distribution that provides the TeX document preparation system.
The enormous installer (over 3gb) creates an environment for creating
scholarly documents that run the gamut of typographical diversity, from
linguistics and paleography to mathematics, formal logic, and the sciences.
All for free.
