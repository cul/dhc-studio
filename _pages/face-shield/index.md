### Introduction

#### What is the problem?

As the [Coronavirus
Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
continues to spread around the world, the global shortage of personal
protective equipment (PPE) becomes more acute. With a 3D printer, however, it
is possible—while supplies last—for ordinary citizens to manufacture PPE and
make them available to hospitals and clinics in their communities.

#### How can I help?

3D printers are very useful for printing visors that can be attached to clear
plastic to make face shields. This site provides documentation and the
necessary model to 3D print visors.

#### What will I need?

The face shield is made up of four parts:
    
2. A 3D-printed visor connecting the elastic to the transparent shield that
   rests on the health care worker’s forehead.
1. A headband holding the shield in place on the health care worker’s
   head.
3. A foam band to press between the health care worker's forehead and the 3D-printed visor.
3. A transparent shield made of thin plastic
    

The rest of this guide is split among these four components.

### The Four Components of a Face Shield

#### 1. The Visor

The visor is 3D printed, using PLA, ABS, or PETG filament. We have moved to
using PETG filament where possible.

[`FaceShieldChoksiMod.stl`](/assets/files/FaceShieldChoksiMod.stl) (by Madiha
Choksi, based on the design provided by [Budmen
Industries](http://budmen.com)) is the `.stl` file to use for printing.

We recommend the following pre-print settings:

  1. Disable Raft.
  2. Set first layer height to 0.3mm.
  4. Set infill to 10%.
  5. Set fill pattern to triangle.
  6. Set perimeter shells to 2.
  7. Set top solid layers to 2.
  8. Set bottom solid layers to 2.

#### 2. The Headband

We have worked with two different solutions for creating the headband, rope
and rubber bands. In both cases, the headband affixes to the visor through the
loops A and B in the figures above and is tied off with knots. 

##### Rubber Bands

To use rubber bands, we recommend using 7″ x 1/8″ jumbo rubber bands
([Uline](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-20822/Desk-Supplies/117B-Rubber-Bands-Bulk-Bag-7-x-1-8),
[Staples](https://www.staples.com/Staples-Big-Rubber-Bands-24-Pack/product_383318)).

1. Cut the rubber band once to break the loop.
1. Tie each end to A and B with overhand knots. 
1. Take care to tighten the knot with the rubber band stretched.

##### Rope

To use rope, we recommend using 1/8″ braided nylon rope
([Uline](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-12866/Twine-Rope/Solid-Braided-Nylon-Rope-1-8-x-500-White),
[Home
Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-8-in-x-48-ft-White-Polypropylene-Diamond-Braid-Rope-72726/206094291)).

1. Cut the rope to about 24″.
2. Feed each end of the 24″ piece of rope through each loop A and B. The rope
   may need some coaxing to fit in the visor holes, but on a correct print it
   should fit.
3. Tie off the end in A with a bowline.
4. Tie off the end in B with a taut-line (or rolling) hitch.
5. Slide the taut-line hitch to adjust the fit of the headband.

Knots*](https://archive.org/details/TheAshleyBookOfKnots/mode/2up).

#### The Foam Band

The foam band provides some comfort to the healthcare worker by cushioning the
visor up against the worker’s forehead. We use standard foam weatherstrip
tape, 3/4″ wide and 7/16” thick, and have been satisfied with the Frost King
implementation of the tape ([Home
Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Frost-King-E-O-3-4-in-x-7-16-in-x-10-ft-Black-High-Density-Rubber-Foam-Weatherstrip-Tape-R734H/100047977)).

Though the foam tape has an adhesive, we have found it necessary to add a
layer of super glue to ensure the bond between the foam tape and the visor. We
prefer the Gorilla Glue gel ([Home
Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gorilla-0-71-oz-Super-Glue-Gel-7700103/205485334),
[Staples](https://www.staples.com/gorilla-gel-permanent-super-glue-0-53-oz-7600101/product_2681657)).
We have found that the 0.53oz bottle is good for about 20 visors.

1. Cut the foam tape to 8”.
2. Apply super glue to the wide band F on the visor (see figure 2, above).
3. Press and hold foam tape against the wide band F, adhesive (concave) side
   in. This means the foam tape has to be curled against the way it comes
   rolled.

#### The Transparent Shield

Finally, the transparent shield is a rectangular sheet of transparent plastic
with four holes punched into it that align themselves with the four tabs on
the visor, marked T in figures 1 and 2 above. We have used Grafix DURA-LAR,
which is 0.005” thick. Alternatively, you can use standard PETG sheets that
can be up to 0.02” thick. The goal is to have a material that curves around
the visor and is thin enough for a hole punch.

1. Cut the sheet to 8.5” x 11”. In a pinch, 9” x 12” will also work.
2. Line up a sheet of paper to the visor and mark where the paper touches all
   four tabs T. 
3. Using those marks as a guide, punch four holes into the plastic sheet.

### Safety Concerns

0. _Wear vinyl gloves and face mask while manufacturing and handling the face
   shield components_.
14. Limit who touches the shield.
2. Spray the shield with a bleach solution to disinfect it.

### Distribution

Detach the transparent shield from the visor to flatten the shield for
transport.

#### Finding Those Who Need Shields

Many organizations are posting their immediate need for PPE to websites and
stating specifically which PPEs are needed. They are accepting used goggles,
cloth face masks and asking the public for face shields. A simple online
search will help you target which organizations specifically requesting face
shields. Invite medical professionals into your teams to allow for networking,
to assess need and to help you navigate the healthcare world. 

Due to how overwhelming COVID-19 has been for organizations and healthcare
professionals, they are centralizing how to donate on social media pages and
are providing email addresses on how to donate. Some websites are stating that
they will check the PPE for use as they come in. We do not believe
specifically contacting procurement offices is necessary, and investigating
where to donate is more important. [Here’s a sample list of places seeking
donations in the United
States](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1txEanDkIrJ5GNfSk-zlXkTlB-bQPNRN_Y69qEwmdme8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=1259409226).

As always, we recommend folks to exercise good judgement and caution when
trying to work with complicated, rapid responses to a crisis. We hope this
guide has been helpful, and wish all of us good luck during this pandemic. If
you need to contact us please write to Alex Gil (<agil@columbia.edu>) and

### Tips on Obtaining Equipment in Collaboration with Admins at Universities/Libraries

Many libraries and universities today usually have maker spaces and other
spaces with 3D printers. If you don’t own one, you may want to work with top
administrators to get access to these printers. An email to the University
Librarian, the Chair of Engineering, or even the Provost might get you access
to otherwise locked buildings to retrieve the equipment. 

Remember that for the full protective shield, you will also need materials and
tools beyond just a 3D printer and filament. Another possible solution is to
reserve the spaces that have all the tools for this use by working with your
administrators.
