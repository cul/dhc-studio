Anaconda is an all-in-one solution for managing projects in Python or R. It
installs an application, called “Navigator,” that lets the user launch a
number of applications that can sometimes have more complex installation (and
launching) procedures. Most notably, Anaconda lets users launch a [Jupyter
Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with just one
click. Furthermore Anaconda comes with common Python libraries like
[numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
[tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/), [nltk](http://nltk.org/), and
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) preinstalled.
