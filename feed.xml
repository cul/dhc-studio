        <title>Decolonizing Data Regimes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please join us next Friday, April 19th at 4pm in Studio Butler (208b) for “Decolonizing Data Regimes” with Dhanashree Thorat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-decolonizing-data-regimes&quot;&gt;Decolonizing Data Regimes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this age of datafication, the quantification of human bodies, behaviors, and interactions has raised myriad concerns about ethics and privacy. My talk takes a media archaeological approach to sift through those prehistories which have shaped our contemporary digital landscape. Specifically, I historicize trends toward datafication in the context of colonial communication networks in the Global South. The data regimes we see today are premised upon a colonial geography and a colonial rhetoric of technomodernity, and to decolonize digital platforms we must take a long historical view on data ethics grounded in the Global South. My talk articulates some of these possibilities for postcolonial data interventions for digital infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-dhanashree-thorat&quot;&gt;Dhanashree Thorat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dhanashree Thorat is a postdoctoral researcher in Digital Humanities at the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Kansas. Her research is situated at the intersection of Asian American Studies, Postcolonial Studies, and Digital Humanities. Broadly, she examines how colonial and racial ideologies shape the technological imagination, specifically in technical infrastructures, platforms, and policies. Her current work focuses on how Muslims use hashtag activism to intervene in public conversations about their racialized bodies. Dhanashree is a founding Executive Council member of the Center for Digital Humanities, Pune in India. She serves as the lead organizer for a biennial winter school on Digital Humanities, and advises the center on digital archival projects and DH curriculum development. She has also served as the co-convenor of the Digital Humanities Working Group at UF, and the Digital Project Manager for the funded project, “Holistic Supports for the UF Digital Collections (UFDC) and Digital Scholarship.” This fall, she will be joining the English department at Mississippi State as an Assistant Professor in Multi-Ethnic U.S. Literature in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Bibliographies to Maps: A Spring Mini-Course</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us on Mondays from April 8th – April 29th at 1:00 – 3:00pm in Studio Butler (Butler 208b) for “Bibliographies to Maps: A Spring Mini-Course,” taught by Digital Scholarship Librarian Alex Gil and GIS / Metadata Librarian Eric Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a story to tell with your bibliography? Do you want to trace the provenance of a collection of manuscripts? We often tend to think of our bibliographies as simply lists of books, forgetting sometimes that the books have a material reality in the world and the silences hidden in bibliographies. The creation of “carto-bibliographies” allows us to start thinking about the locations that play a role in the production, circulation and archiving of books. In this mini course, you will be learning how to navigate three tools to produce maps from your bibliographies: Zotero, Open Refine and Carto. The course is also an excellent introduction to these tools, transforming data, and how to leverage a mix of tools, as a opposed to one comprehensive tool, to perform specific project tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop #1:
Using Zotero to Record Location
Monday, April 8
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will revisit some of Zotero’s basic functionality. We will discuss what it means to add geographical information to bibliographic items. We will learn how to leverage the Extra field in Zotero to add geo-data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop #2:
Cleaning Data With Open Refine
Monday, April 15
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will install and learn how to use OpenRefine for basic data cleanup. We will learn how to separate columns from a CSV by using delimiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop #3:
Introduction to Carto
Monday, April 22
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will explore CARTO mapping options and customization capabilities. We will discuss base maps, styling, labels and annotations, layout strategies and publishing options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop #4:
Publishing Your Webmap
Monday, April 29
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will explore how to take your table of locations from your bibliography and visualize them using CARTO, an online mapping platform. You will create your own CARTO account, upload your data and use CARTO geocoding services to map your location. Then we will create a basic web map in the CARTO environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ethical Pedagogy Directory Edit-a-thon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us on Wednesday, April 3rd from 2:00 – 5:00pm at the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard (Milstein 103) in an edit-a-thon, where we will work with other university groups in the US to edit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethicaledtech.info&quot;&gt;Ethical EdTech directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational technology often serves as the vanguard of profit-seeking entities who surveil students unable to opt out of software used in the classroom. We invite you to participate in improving the Ethical EdTech directory of educational tools that exist outside of the profit and surveillance nexus that characterises so much educational technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:00: Videoconference introductions and edit-a-thon instruction
2:30: Edit
4:30: Closing discussion
Throughout: snacks&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Art of Data 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join Columbia Libraries and the Brown Institute for an afternoon of talks about data and New York City. Learn how scholars and writers across disciplines use data to tell stories, make sense of our city, and uncover overlooked urban experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class=&quot;col-9&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;How do rodents move through our cities?&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cities exhibit considerable variation in “gray” built infrastructure, “green” or “blue” natural areas, and socioeconomic characteristics of human neighborhoods. Cities are also inhabited by a complex mix of native wildlife and non-native species introduced by humans. These species face many ecological and evolutionary challenges from urbanization, including moving through landscapes constructed primarily for human use. This talk will address how tools from landscape ecology and populations can be used to infer and visualize the movements of wildlife through cities. Examples discussed will include native white-footed mice in New York City, and invasive brown rats in four cities with different characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Munshi-South&lt;/strong&gt; is a Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and the Louis Calder Center at Fordham University. His lab studies the ecological and evolutionary consequences of urbanization for wildlife populations, with a particular focus on New York City. Of particular fascination for Jason are the rodents that live in and around our urban homes, but his lab studies organisms ranging from mammals to lichens.&lt;/p&gt;

Brooklyn&lt;/em&gt; (2016) as case studies, this presentation examines the ways in which humanities researchers extract and encode spatial data from literary accounts of the city. It asks whether the racialized, gendered, and temporally multivalent experiences of NYC encoded in these and other texts offer models for how we site both the comparatively small data sets that underpin literary cartography projects and our own relationships with the city as participants in data-driven narrative placemaking.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Afsari-Mamagani&lt;/strong&gt; is a doctoral student in English at NYU, working on a dissertation that reads post-9/11 American fiction representing the lived experiences of marginalized communities as the site of a theory and ethics of interaction design for educational resources. In her teaching and research, she centers the relationship between everyday information structures and long, violent histories of colonialism and nation-building. She currently serves as a doctoral fellow in digital research and pedagogy with the NewYorkScapes research collaborative, which seeks to build community at the intersection of cultural heritage, spatial and urban studies, and digital methods. Grace is a member of the 2018-2020 HASTAC Scholars cohort, a former Polonsky-Brine digital humanities fellow at NYU, a former MLA Connected Academics fellow, and a recovering marketing agency project manager. Her professional interests include instructional design, educational technology, and digital project consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Machine Learning and Human Interpretive Theory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us on Thursday, March 28th from 4:00 – 5:30pm for “Machine Learning and Human Interpretive Theory” with Ted Underwood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-machine-learning-and-human-interpretive-theory&quot;&gt;Machine Learning and Human Interpretive Theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principled doubts about the humanistic significance of numbers can’t be dispelled by terms like “big data” that seem to point at the sheer speed and scale of computers. This talk will instead explore the interpretive assumptions that underpin statistical models, using examples drawn from the history of fantasy and science fiction to show how machine learning can be used to model specific historical vantage points and measure the parallax between perspectives. It is getting easier to move between qualitative and quantitative disciplines, I will argue, not because data is big, but because practices of statistical modeling have quietly drifted toward humanistic theories of interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-ted-underwood&quot;&gt;Ted Underwood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted Underwood is a Professor of Information Sciences and of English at University of Illinois. His research considers how we can use information science as literary criticism, particularly in the application of machine learning to large digital collections. His most recent book, &lt;em&gt;Digital Horizons: Digital Evidence and Literary Change&lt;/em&gt;, published this year by the University of Chicago Press, uses the data of newly available digital libraries to deepen our understanding of the large arcs of archives and literary change. He is also the author of &lt;em&gt;Why Literary Periods Mattered: Historical Contrast and the Prestige of English Studies&lt;/em&gt; (Stanford University Press, 2013) and &lt;em&gt;The Work of the Sun: Literature, Science, and Political Economy, 1760-1860&lt;/em&gt; (Palgrave, 2005). His articles have appeared in &lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Modern Language Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cultural Analytics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Big Data and Society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Association for Computational Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Literary History&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Representations&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Journal of Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love Data, Love Postcards</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of Columbia’s annual week of &lt;a href=&quot;https://universitylife.columbia.edu/wellness-days-columbia-schedule&quot;&gt;Wellness
Days&lt;/a&gt;
activities, Columbia University Libraries again hosted its postcard project.
Blank postcards were distributed around the various libraries at the
university and periodically collected. They were subsequently stamped at no
cost to the author and sent off to their final destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the librarians at the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences
Libraries decided to add a wrinkle: we would make a note of where every
postcard was addressed to, building up a table of US states and countries that
would soon be receiving postcards from the Columbia community. We updated the
data every evening, so patrons could follow along, and the final map looks
like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-19&quot; style=&quot;height: 50vh&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-19-legend&quot; class=&quot;mb-3 w-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some raw numbers, that is 998 postcards sent to 54 countries and 46 states
in the US (what’s up, Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, and Wyoming?). From a
visualization perspective, the map above does a good job of showing the spread
of states and countries. And now that we know that 998 postcards were sent, we
can infer from the coloring that a quarter of all postcards went to two
destinations: New York and China. In fact, here are the top fives for
countries and states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col-6&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col-6&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;Massachusetts and New Jersey (24)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharp-eyed data-thinkers might be all-together unsurprised by these numbers.
China and India are the two most populous nations in the world, after all. If
we chose postcard recipients around the world at &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt;, we would have
expected about &lt;em&gt;200&lt;/em&gt; postcards to go to China, not the 120 we actually had.
Similarly, the top four states are all in the top six of states by population
in the US, with Texas (22) and Pennsylvania (14) missing this cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we reformulate the map taking into account populations, we can elicit some
new insights from the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-population-19&quot; style=&quot;height: 50vh&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-population-19-legend&quot; class=&quot;mb-3 w-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, China has 11 million people per postcard, which is right inline with the
average we collected (discounting 0s) of 12 million people per postcard. The
median, however, is 1.8 million people per postcard, a level a country like
Australia or a state like West Virginia met. In other words, when you click on
a country or state above and get its precise count, you’ll know whether it
seems to have gotten “too many” postcards for its population, like the
Northern Mariana Islands, which shares one postcard with all 55 thousand
inhabitants, or “too few,” like Indonesia, which shares one postcard with all
240 million inhabitants. Unfortunately, because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplestatistics.org/docs/#ckmeans&quot;&gt;Ckmeans
clustering&lt;/a&gt; we are using to break
up the data into five groups, nearly every observation falls within the
darkest category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a map from this dataset, however, carries other risks. We like to make
maps in part because we often infer stories from the resulting
representations. The maps in this post conjure images of the postcards sitting
in sacks, floating across oceans in steamships. We exoticize the smaller or
more “remote” locations (Northern Mariana Islands!). Just by choosing to map
the data, we’ve already narrativized it to a degree. But there’s a further
issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web map turns the three-dimensional Earth into a two-dimensional plane, doing
rather significant distortion to the landmasses that make up that
three-dimensional Earth by using the de facto standard
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection&quot;&gt;Web Mercator&lt;/a&gt;
projection, wherein Africa is shrunken in size and Russia, Greenland, and
Canada are enlarged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, also importantly, what we are drawing on the plane are shapes with
areas, not dots of people. The shape labeled “China” is not receiving 120
postcards. Rather, 120 people (or so) who happen to live within the area
represented by that shape are receiving postcards. Yet we color the whole
shape as representative of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes a handful of important moves in visualization that can often be
considered “errors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the visualization assumes people are distributed evenly within a
geographical space. That is, if we were to pick a pixel of the webmap within
China, it has the same likelihood of representing where a postcard recipient
lives as any other pixel within that shape. This is not the case; anecdotally,
many of the China-directed postcards went to Beijing or Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, even when normalizing data for population, our web maps still use
&lt;em&gt;area&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;population&lt;/em&gt;, to visualize data. Because area and population are
different measures, this sort of visualization can also lead to suboptimal
conclusions, which is a common problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map&quot;&gt;choropleth
maps&lt;/a&gt; (polygons shaded different
colors where the colors have meaning). That is, while showing a variable of
&lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; (people &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; postcard) is better than showing a variable of
&lt;em&gt;magnitude&lt;/em&gt; (postcards), the shapes still show area, not population.  Hence, a
“more correct” visualization would take our density and further divide by area
(postcard per people per square meter, say). Yet if we doubly normalize the
data, it becomes harder to grasp precisely what the different shades of blue
on the map “mean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Web Mercator projection is not an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection&quot;&gt;equal-area&lt;/a&gt;
projection. So even if we were to use a library like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://turfjs.com&quot;&gt;Turf.js&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the area of each country in terms
of square meters, that calculation does not translate to the number of pixels
contained by the shape represented in the web map. For example, in the image
below, the square surrounding Greenland is 175 by 266 pixels in size, giving
an area of 46,550 pixels. In the meantime, the square surrounding India is 85
by 87 pixels, for an area of 7,395 pixels. Visually, the square surrounding
Greenland is over five times larger than the one surrounding India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hCmQwVh.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded&quot; alt=&quot;World with Greenland and India boxed.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, however, India is about 1.5 times larger than Greenland.
Turf.js measures areas of 3.2T m² and 2.2T m² for the two countries, which
matches the Wikipedia listed areas of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-india.gov.in2-6&quot;&gt;3.2M
km²&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Greenland&quot;&gt;2.2M
km²&lt;/a&gt;. Even if, then, the
data were to be further normalized by area “on the ground,” the distortions in
the webmap would remain, further obscuring whatever narrative we are aiming to
build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the “right” way to show the data we collected? It turns out there
isn’t one. While some may be “more right” than others (representing magnitudes
in choropleth maps is hardly ever a good idea), every decision made while
building the visualization requires consideration. More than anything,
however, the most important thing is to show that the Columbia community made
great use of the postcards this year, underscoring how global Columbia’s reach
truly is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe next year we’ll normalize the postcard distribution using admissions
data on where our students come from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in maps and data, consider stopping by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html&quot;&gt;meeting of Map
Club or Data
Club&lt;/a&gt;,

        <title>Love Data Week 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Get involved in this week’s &lt;a href=&quot;#s-postcard-project&quot;&gt;Postcard Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#s-love-data-week-2019-instagram-challenge&quot;&gt;Love Data
Week 2019 Instagram Challenge&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#s-love-data-photobooths&quot;&gt;Love Data Photobooths&lt;/a&gt;, and,
finally, &lt;a href=&quot;#s-love-data-kisses&quot;&gt;Love Data Kisses&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 11–15 is not only Columbia’s annual week of &lt;a href=&quot;https://universitylife.columbia.edu/wellness-days-columbia-schedule&quot;&gt;Wellness
Days&lt;/a&gt;
activities, but it also marks &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovedataweek.org/&quot;&gt;Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;. At
the Studio, we support both wellness and loving data, and we are teaming up
with our colleagues in the Columbia University Libraries to provide some
activities that generate public data in the interest of this year’s Love Data
Week theme, “data in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-postcard-project&quot;&gt;Postcard Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libraries are letting you send postcards to your loved ones around the
world this week. At nine Columbia Libraries
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/avery.html&quot;&gt;Avery&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html&quot;&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html&quot;&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/journalism.html&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html&quot;&gt;Lehman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-engineering.html&quot;&gt;Science and
Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/social-work.html&quot;&gt;Social Work&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/business.html&quot;&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt;), you will be
able to fill out postcards, and Columbia Libraries will pick up the postage.
In exchange, we’ll be keeping track of what states and countries the postcards
are addressed to, and we’re building a world map of places our community is
reaching out to this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-19&quot; style=&quot;height: 50vh&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;love-data-map-19-legend&quot; class=&quot;mb-3 w-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-love-data-week-2019-instagram-challenge&quot;&gt;Love Data Week 2019 Instagram Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Libraries Division
(SESSL) is organizing an Instagram Challenge. Throughout their five libraries
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/journalism.html&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html&quot;&gt;Lehman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-engineering.html&quot;&gt;Science and
Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/social-work.html&quot;&gt;Social Work&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/business.html&quot;&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt;), they have
placed large Valentines. Your goal is to photograph yourself in front of one
and then post it to Instagram, hashtagged
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lovedata19/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#LoveData19&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lovecolumbia/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#LoveColumbia&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll
give out gift cards to three lucky winners: first, best, and “other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, we’ll build a data visualization of when the competing
stories were posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-love-data-photobooths&quot;&gt;Love Data Photobooths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SESSL is also organizing an opportunity to have you pose in their
photobooths to announce your support of open data and the Libraries.
One booth will be in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html&quot;&gt;Lehman&lt;/a&gt; all week. The
other one will be roaming around the other SESSL Libraries,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html&quot;&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html&quot;&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt;. Both will be at
Butler in on Thursday evening during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bb9e25-68a32c67-0168-a4614696-00000965events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=&quot;&gt;Night @
Butler&lt;/a&gt; event, from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full schedule for roaming photobooth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html&quot;&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-engineering.html&quot;&gt;Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/social-work.html&quot;&gt;Social
Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Burke, Science and Engineering, Social Work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Burke, &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/journalism.html&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.columbia.edu/locations/business.html&quot;&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;: Burke, Butler, Journalism, Watson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-love-data-kisses&quot;&gt;Love Data Kisses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are chocolate kisses floating around this week from the
Libraries and from the open data community. Find them and enjoy them, either
by sharing them with loved ones or keeping them all to yourself. Or something
in between.&lt;/p&gt;
