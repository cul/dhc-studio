### Peer Review and Pretzels @ Publishing Open Lab

Come join us Monday, February 25th at 3pm for a special edition of publishing open lab. Asked to peer review somebody else's work and don't know where to start? Worried that you might have to be a peer reviewer some day? We'll talk through what responsible, ethical peer review looks like, how to provide critical but constructive feedback, and how to get credit for the work you put into the peer review process. Also, pretzels! 

The open publishing lab is a space for the Columbia community to explore open, ethical publishing practices and tools and build research communication expertise in a respectful, welcoming environment. Come find your next collaborators and co-conspirators!
