Join us on Mondays from April 8th – April 29th at 1:00 – 3:00pm in Studio Butler (Butler 208b) for "Bibliographies to Maps: A Spring Mini-Course," taught by Digital Scholarship Librarian Alex Gil and GIS / Metadata Librarian Eric Glass.

Do you have a story to tell with your bibliography? Do you want to trace the provenance of a collection of manuscripts? We often tend to think of our bibliographies as simply lists of books, forgetting sometimes that the books have a material reality in the world and the silences hidden in bibliographies. The creation of "carto-bibliographies" allows us to start thinking about the locations that play a role in the production, circulation and archiving of books. In this mini course, you will be learning how to navigate three tools to produce maps from your bibliographies: Zotero, Open Refine and Carto. The course is also an excellent introduction to these tools, transforming data, and how to leverage a mix of tools, as a opposed to one comprehensive tool, to perform specific project tasks.

Dates

Workshop #1:
Using Zotero to Record Location
Monday, April 8
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will revisit some of Zotero's basic functionality. We will discuss what it means to add geographical information to bibliographic items. We will learn how to leverage the Extra field in Zotero to add geo-data.


Workshop #2:
Cleaning Data With Open Refine
Monday, April 15
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will install and learn how to use OpenRefine for basic data cleanup. We will learn how to separate columns from a CSV by using delimiters.

Workshop #3:
Introduction to Carto
Monday, April 22
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will explore CARTO mapping options and customization capabilities. We will discuss base maps, styling, labels and annotations, layout strategies and publishing options.

Workshop #4:
Publishing Your Webmap
Monday, April 29
1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Description: We will explore how to take your table of locations from your bibliography and visualize them using CARTO, an online mapping platform. You will create your own CARTO account, upload your data and use CARTO geocoding services to map your location. Then we will create a basic web map in the CARTO environment.
