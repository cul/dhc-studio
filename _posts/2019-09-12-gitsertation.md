[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is free software for creating and managing
reproducible, portable, sustainable, and integrated scholarship. Programmers
around the world use it to manage software projects, from small scripts with
one author to massive, collaborative projects with unspeakable complexity.

The underlying Git system, however, is also extremely useful for writing and
managing a complex research project, as well, such as a dissertation or
monograph. 

Librarian Moacir P. de Sá Pereira will be leading two “PhD Gitsertation”
workshops to help new learners install and use Git and integrate it into their
research workflow. Bring your laptop and see how you can write a great
dissertation with Git!

### Git Tracks Changes

Git is primarily version control software, ensuring you
are always using the correct version of all the files in your project. No more
`chapter2FINALeditsREALLYFINAL.docx` file naming systems.

### Git Backs up Your Work

As a distributed system, Git lets you back up your
work and push it to the cloud, meaning you always have access to the entire
history of your project.

### Git Serves as a Writing Journal

Git relies on unique markers in time that you set, letting you keep track of
the changes you made over the course of a writing session and giving you a
diary to consult.

### Git Handles to-dos

When integrated with GitHub and ZenHub, your Git-managed
project becomes even more manageable, with adding to-dos (issues), tracking
progress over time, and setting project milestones.
