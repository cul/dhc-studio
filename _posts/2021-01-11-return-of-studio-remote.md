Last semester, in an effort to recreate the kind of collaborative community of
digital scholarship that is a calling card of the Studio, librarians Alex Gil
and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira launched [Studio
Remote](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/2020/10/13/studio-remote-launch/).
Streaming live [Friday
afternoons on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio/schedule), Alex and
Moacir began building what they call the “Rose Hall Project,” using archival
data on enslaved persons at Rose Hall Plantation in Montego Bay, Jamaica,
collected by [Celia E.
Naylor](https://barnard.edu/profiles/celia-e-naylor), Professor of Africana
Studies and History at Barnard College, Columbia University.

The work resumes this Friday, January 15, at 3pm New York City time, on
[Twitch](http://twitch.tv/culstudio). In the first semester, Alex and Moacir
were able to [sketch a basic web application using artificial
data](https://github.com/muziejus/rose-hall). This semester, they will improve
the user experience and aesthetic appeal of the site, with a planned launch at
the end of the semester.

Additionally, Studio Remote is adding a second show, “[Coding with the
Dead](http://studio.cul.columbia.edu/2021/01/11/coding-with-the-dead-launch/),” that will air on Tuesdays,
3pm–5pm, starting on January 19th.

If you can’t make the streams live, they are archived on the Studio [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLOUh6s8E2FYAVAsJg3lgoA).
