We are happy to announce the Collaboratory Clinic, an appointment-based free consulting service for students and researchers at Columbia University that offers assistance with planning and executing data driven research projects, including help with data visualization, analysis and prediction, both in conceptual terms and with concrete software implementations. The Clinic is a partnership between the Studio@Butler and the Collaboratory@Columbia.

Jointly founded by Columbia University’s Data Science Institute and Columbia Entrepreneurship, the Collaboratory@Columbia is a university-wide program dedicated to supporting collaborative curricula innovations designed to ensure that all Columbia University students receive the education and training that they need to succeed in today’s data rich world.

The Collaboratory Clinic will provide free in-person assistance with data science related queries to any member of the Columbia Community. If you would like assistance, please fill out [our form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CollaboratoryClinic).
