Atom is a text editor provided by the people at GitHub. Extensively
customisable and with Git and GitHub support built-in, Atom is a great tool
for beginners and experts alike, no matter what kind of text they are
producing. Its integrated Markdown support makes writing prose
straightforward, and its infinitely extendable syntax checkers and linters
make it a tool for programming in any language.
