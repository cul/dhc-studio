In response to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) as
hospitals and clinics scramble to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Librarians
at Columbia University Libraries have released a [Guide and Design for Rapidly
Manufacturing Face Shields](/face-shield) with
a 3D printer and household tools.

On Thursday, March 19, 2020, Dr. Pierre Elias, a Columbia University
Cardiology Fellow, reached out to Research and Learning Technologies Librarian
Madiha Choksi to utilize the Columbia University Libraries’ 3D printers to
produce supplemental face shields. Dr. Elias sent along a design for a face
shield visor posted by [Budmen Industries](http://www.budmen.com). Choksi took
the Budmen design and optimized it, cutting the printing time by one third.

The new visor design takes about an hour to print, and the acetate for the
front of the shield can be cut and molded by hand. A hole-punch makes the
holes that connect the front of the shield to the visor.

Choksi was eager to help with the PPE crisis, and once Dr. Elias’s request
came in, she moved quickly to transport two idle printers from Columbia’s
Butler Library, which [has been closed since Sunday, March 15, in response to
the COVID-19 health
emergency](https://library.columbia.edu/about/news/alert.html), to her home.
Because she only had two printers, she scaled down the visor’s size by less
than 10 percent to dramatically reduce printing time. Additionally, she angled
the visor to make it easier for health professionals to don protective masks
below the shield. 

Next, Choksi enlisted the help of other librarians who work in the
Studio. Digital Scholarship Librarian Alex Gil and Research Data Librarian
Moacir P. de Sá Pereira created the [Guide and Design for Rapidly Produced
Face Shields](/face-shield) webpage for distributing the optimized visor
design and instructions to other academic libraries in the US and to people
beyond the US borders who are also eager to help address the worldwide PPE
shortage. The instructions are available in English (and soon in Spanish),
with other translations to follow. Contributors must exercise care over
producing the shields and sterilize the shields before distributing them to
health professionals. In so doing, the Studio is contributing to the efforts
of [Get us PPE](https://getusppe.org/), an online consortium of crowd-sourced,
citizen-manufactured PPE. 

Choksi delivered five prototype shields on March 21 to Dr. Elias, who quickly
asked for 1,000 more for New York Presbyterian Hospitals. To meet the growing
demand, librarian Jeremiah Trinidad-Christensen, who is the Head of Research
Data Services and the Interim Co-Director of the Science, Engineering, and
Social Sciences Libraries Division, reached out to Columbia faculty at both
the [Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied
Science](http://engineering.columbia.edu) and the [Graduate School of
Architecture, Planning, and Preservation](http://arch.columbia.edu) to
commandeer their unused 3D printers. 

On March 23, Choksi is traveling to Tangible Creative’s 700-square-foot
production space in Newark, NJ, to oversee production of additional shields.
[Tangible Creative](http://tangiblecreative.com), a 3D printing services
company, has agreed to mobilize their wall of printers to help meet Dr.
Elias’s demand.

Finally, Choksi was able to deliver ten prototypes to Laurell Taylor, RN,
who has distributed them to front line health care workers around New
York City to test for usability and durability. The workers include ICU
nurses, nursing administrators, and medical assistants processing laboratory
specimens.

The original face shield design was developed by Isaac Budmen and Stephanie
Keefe, who produced 300 shields to share among medical professionals in
Onondaga County, in upstate New York. They made the design available to others
with access to 3D printers, as long as they agreed to sign a waiver releasing
Budmen Industries of any liability.

The Butler Library 3D printers are part of a 3D printing service the Columbia
University Libraries provide to members of the Columbia Community.
