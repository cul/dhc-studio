            <h4>How do rodents move through our cities?</h4>
            <p>Cities exhibit considerable variation in “gray” built infrastructure, “green” or “blue” natural areas, and socioeconomic characteristics of human neighborhoods. Cities are also inhabited by a complex mix of native wildlife and non-native species introduced by humans. These species face many ecological and evolutionary challenges from urbanization, including moving through landscapes constructed primarily for human use. This talk will address how tools from landscape ecology and populations can be used to infer and visualize the movements of wildlife through cities. Examples discussed will include native white-footed mice in New York City, and invasive brown rats in four cities with different characteristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Jason Munshi-South</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and the Louis Calder Center at Fordham University. His lab studies the ecological and evolutionary consequences of urbanization for wildlife populations, with a particular focus on New York City. Of particular fascination for Jason are the rodents that live in and around our urban homes, but his lab studies organisms ranging from mammals to lichens.</p>

            <h4>Sitations: Small Data, Identity, and the Poetics of Place</h4>

            <p>Highlighting Teju Cole’s <em>Open City</em> (2011) and Jacqueline Woodson’s <em>Another
Brooklyn</em> (2016) as case studies, this presentation examines the ways in which humanities researchers extract and encode spatial data from literary accounts of the city. It asks whether the racialized, gendered, and temporally multivalent experiences of NYC encoded in these and other texts offer models for how we site both the comparatively small data sets that underpin literary cartography projects and our own relationships with the city as participants in data-driven narrative placemaking.</p>

            <p><strong>Grace Afsari-Mamagani</strong> is a doctoral student in English at NYU, working on a dissertation that reads post-9/11 American fiction representing the lived experiences of marginalized communities as the site of a theory and ethics of interaction design for educational resources. In her teaching and research, she centers the relationship between everyday information structures and long, violent histories of colonialism and nation-building. She currently serves as a doctoral fellow in digital research and pedagogy with the NewYorkScapes research collaborative, which seeks to build community at the intersection of cultural heritage, spatial and urban studies, and digital methods. Grace is a member of the 2018-2020 HASTAC Scholars cohort, a former Polonsky-Brine digital humanities fellow at NYU, a former MLA Connected Academics fellow, and a recovering marketing agency project manager. Her professional interests include instructional design, educational technology, and digital project consulting.</p>
