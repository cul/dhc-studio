**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

In response to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) as hospitals and clinics scramble to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Columbia University Libraries has released a [Guide and Design for Rapidly Manufacturing Face Shields](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/face-shield/) with a 3d printer and household tools.

On Thursday, March 19, 2020, Dr. Pierre Elias, a Columbia University Cardiologist reached out to Research and Learning Technologies Librarian Madiha Choksi to utilize the Columbia University Libraries’ 3D printers to produce supplemental face shields. Dr. Elias sent along a design for a face shield visor posted by Budmen Industries. Choksi took the Budmen design and optimized it, cutting the printing time by one third. The updated design is now available at http://studio.cul.columbia.edu/face-shield

The new visor design takes about an hour to print, and the acetate for the front of the shield can be cut and molded by hand. A hole-punch makes the holes that connect the front of the shield to the visor.

Choksi was eager to help with the PPE crisis, and once Dr. Elias’s request came in, she moved quickly to transport two idle printers from Columbia’s Butler Library, which has been closed since Sunday, March 15, in response to the COVID-19 health emergency, to her home. Because she only had two printers, she scaled down the visor’s size by less than 10 percent to dramatically reduce printing time. Additionally, she angled the visor to make it easier for health professionals to don protective masks below the shield. 

A member of the Columbia University Libraries’s Studio, which enables and promotes ethical, sustainable, and collaborative digital, data-driven research and pedagogy, Choksi enlisted the help of other librarians who work in the Studio. Digital Scholarship Librarian, Alex Gil, and Research Data Librarian, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, created the [Guide and Design for Rapidly Produced Face Shields](http://studio.cul.columbia.edu/face-shield) webpage for distributing the optimized visor design and instructions to other academic libraries in the US and people beyond the US borders, eager to help address the worldwide PPE shortage. The instructions are available in English (and soon in Spanish), with other translations to follow. Contributors must exercise care over producing the shields and sterilize the shields before distributing them to health professionals.

Choksi delivered five prototype shields on March 21 to Dr. Elias, who quickly asked for 1,000 more for New York Presbyterian Hospitals. To meet the growing demand, librarian Jeremiah Trinidad-Christensen, who is the Head of Research Data Services and the Interim Co-Director of the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Libraries Division, reached out to Columbia faculty at both the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Graduate School of Architecture and Public Planning to commandeer their unused 3d printers. 

On March 23, Choksi is traveling to Tangible Creative’s 700-square-foot production space in Newark, NJ. Tangible Creative, a 3D printing services company, has agreed to mobilize their wall of printers to help meet Dr. Elias’s demand.

Additionally, Choksi was able to deliver 10 prototypes to Laurell Taylor, a Registered Nurse, who in turn, distributed them to front line workers who were able to validate the immediate need and usability of the shields.

The original face shield design was developed by Isaac Budmen and Stephanie Keefe, who produced 300 shields to share among medical professionals in Onondaga County, in upstate New York. They made the design available to others with access to 3d printers, as long as they agreed to sign a waiver releasing Budmen Industries of any liability.

The Butler Library 3D printers are part of a 3D printing service the Columbia University Libraries provide members of the Columbia Community.
