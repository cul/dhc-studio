How To Read is a Columbia-based podcast which aims to communicate the ideas of humanities scholars in an accessible and bitesized format to a non-academic audience. We will be using the Studio space to develop our digital outreach strategy (website design, social media, web analytics) as well as recording and editing audio and video content.
