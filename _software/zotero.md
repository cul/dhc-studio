Zotero simplifies citation management for scholars across disciplines. It not
only stores your list of references online as well as on your computer, but it
also provides “connectors” to websites that can understand the metadata of
many journals and library holdings, meaning adding new items to your citation
database is often simply a one-click affair. Furthermore, in addition to
integrating with traditional word processing software programs like Microsoft
Word, Zotero can also produce auto-updating BibTeX documents that can be used
with [Pandoc](./pandoc) to create properly cited scholarly articles and
manuscripts.
