We miss the social life that we fostered around our collaborative research and learning, especially every Friday from 3pm to 5pm at the Studio Butler. This summer, after wrapping up our work building a grass roots coalition to provide our city with much needed PPE, we started to offer our support to faculty, students and colleagues again, adjusting to our intensified virtual research and learning environments. As part of our renewed effort, we began to dream of new and creative programming that would be more appropriate to our new ways of working. Today Columbia University Libraries Studio is proud to announce the first of such initiatives: Studio Remote.

Starting Friday, October 23rd, 2020, and continuing thereafter every Friday from 3PM to 5PM—on our old Studio Butler Open Lab hours—librarians [Moacir P de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com/) and [Alex Gil](http://elotroalex.com/) will be your hosts on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio/) as they live stream original programming designed around specific projects and ideas. We invite students, faculty, and colleagues from Columbia and around the world to join us as we build digital scholarship projects live, step-by-step. While we broadcast, you will be welcome to ask us questions or offer us feedback in Twitch's chat section. If you’re otherwise engaged on Fridays, you can also catch our recordings later on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLOUh6s8E2FYAVAsJg3lgoA). We hope that building these projects in the open and live might replicate how we critique, shape and implement digital scholarship ideas in real time when you're not watching. This shared space we hope will help those who are embarking on or have embarked on projects of their own, the DH-curious perhaps, and definitely those veterans who would like to join our conversation.

Do not be surprised if we invite you to jump from the comments to our video stream!
