The developing librarian program continues this spring with a series of presentations featuring Digital Humanities projects and scholarship.  This forum allows our librarians to share their work and experiences with one another and to talk about how we collaborate with interns, postdocs and other scholars working on digital humanities and methods.

These sessions are by invitation only.
