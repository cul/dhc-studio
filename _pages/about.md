In 2013, the Columbia University Libraries’ [Digital Humanities
Center](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dhc.html), along
with the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Teaching
Center](http://teachingcenter.wikischolars.columbia.edu/), established
“Studio@Butler,” which they described as a space “[designed to support emerging
practices in pedagogy and digital
scholarship](https://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2013/2013-9-11_Studio_Butler_Opens.html).” 

With two founding organizations, Studio@Butler has pursued two distinct, but
related goals. Digital Scholarship Coordinator Alex Gil has scheduled talks,
trainings, researchathons, labs, and many other happenings in the space.
Similarly, initially Studio@Butler housed the GSAS Teaching Center, a
professional development resource for graduate students that merged into
Columbia’s new Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) in 2015. CTL holds
workshops for graduate students in Studio@Butler as well as a range of
presentations, course labs, and informal gatherings.  Director of Graduate
Student Programs and Initiatives Mark Phillipson has programmed Studio events
for the CTL.

Since its inception, the Studio has worked with faculty both on a one-on-one
basis as well as by collaborating with research collectives. For example, the
Studio has facilitated an [Open Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab) environment for the 
[Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research at Columbia
University](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in), which made use of connections
forged at the studio in some of its most high-profile work, such as [_Torn
Apart/Separados_](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/), a set of
visualizations looking at immigration in the US in 2018.

Similarly, the Studio has featured programming in collaboration with other
units within the Columbia University Libraries. In 2017, for example, 25 librarians helped over 60
volunteers during the [Puerto Rico
Mapathon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/nyregion/maps-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria.html),
in which we all worked together to improve maps of Puerto Rico in the
aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

In 2018, it became clear that Studio@Butler has been pursuing a vision similar
to that of [Research Data
Services](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html),
a part of the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Library Division.
Beginning in 2019, then, Studio@Butler has been renamed to the Columbia University Libraries Studio Butler,
and will be working in partnership with RDS’s space in the Lehman Social
Sciences Library, now called the Columbia University Libraries Studio Lehman. In the future, we hope to
expand further.

### Organization

The Studio is a flat organization, managed by full-time librarians in both the
[Digital
Schoalrship](https://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship)
division and in [Research Data
Services](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html),
a part of the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Libraries.
Concretely, this means that Alex Gil (DS) works with Jeremiah
Trinidad-Christensen (RDS) to align programming between sites, ensuring a
similar commitment to ethical, sustainable, collaborative, and <abbr
title="Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable" class="initialism">FAIR</abbr> research
and pedagogy. For more on FAIR research and pedagogy, please [consult the Libraries’ scholarly communications
page](https://scholcomm.columbia.edu/research-data.html#FAIRdata).

The Studio does not currently have a faculty advisory committee, but in the
past it has been helped greatly by [Associate Professor Manan
Ahmed](https://history.columbia.edu/faculty/manan-ahmed/) (History), [Jacob H.
Schiff Foundations Professor Emeritus of Psychology & Education Herbert
Ginsburg](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/hpg4/) (Teachers College), and
[Associate Professor Dennis
Tenen](https://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/453) (English and
Comparative Literature).

### The Lion

}}" class="ml-3 p-3 w-25 img-thumbnail float-right">
</a>

Our logo, our lion, was provided by Associate Professor Manan Ahmed. It is
taken from page 384 of Władysław Łoziński’s text [_Patrycyat i mieszczaństwo
lwowskie w XVI i XVII
wieku_](http://primocat.bl.uk/F?func=direct&local_base=ITEMV&doc_number=002273904&con_lng=eng)
(Lviv: Gubrynowicz i Schmidt, 1892), and it is a drawing, by J. Makarewicz, of
a Lion from the sacristy of the Lviv Cathedral.  The original caption reads: 

> Lewek, rzeźba z ołtarza wotywnego mieszczańskiego, znajdującego się dziś w
zakrystyi kościoła katedralnego we Lwowie. Rysował z oryginału J. <span
