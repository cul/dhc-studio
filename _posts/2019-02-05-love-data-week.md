Get involved in this week’s [Postcard Project](#s-postcard-project), [Love Data
Week 2019 Instagram Challenge](#s-love-data-week-2019-instagram-challenge),
[Love Data Photobooths](#s-love-data-photobooths), and,
finally, [Love Data Kisses](#s-love-data-kisses)!

February 11–15 is not only Columbia’s annual week of [Wellness
Days](https://universitylife.columbia.edu/wellness-days-columbia-schedule)
activities, but it also marks [Love Data Week](https://lovedataweek.org/). At
the Studio, we support both wellness and loving data, and we are teaming up
with our colleagues in the Columbia University Libraries to provide some
activities that generate public data in the interest of this year’s Love Data
Week theme, “data in everyday life.”

### Postcard Project

The Libraries are letting you send postcards to your loved ones around the
world this week. At nine Columbia Libraries
([Avery](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/avery.html)
[Burke](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html),
[Butler](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html),
[Journalism](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/journalism.html),
[Lehman](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html), [Science and
Engineering](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-engineering.html),
[Social Work](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/social-work.html), and
[Watson](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/business.html)), you will be
able to fill out postcards, and Columbia Libraries will pick up the postage.
In exchange, we’ll be keeping track of what states and countries the postcards
are addressed to, and we’re building a world map of places our community is
reaching out to this week:

### Love Data Week 2019 Instagram Challenge

Similarly, the Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences Libraries Division
(SESSL) is organizing an Instagram Challenge. Throughout their five libraries
([Journalism](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/journalism.html),
[Lehman](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html), [Science and
Engineering](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/science-engineering.html),
[Social Work](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/social-work.html), and
[Watson](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/business.html)), they have
placed large Valentines. Your goal is to photograph yourself in front of it
and then post an Instagram post of the five photos, hashtagged
[`#LoveData19`](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lovedata19/) and
[`#LoveColumbia`](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lovecolumbia/). We’ll
give out gift cards to three lucky winners: first, best, and “other.”

At the end of the week, we’ll build a data visualization of when the competing
stories were posted.

### Love Data Photobooths

SESSL is also organizing an opportunity to have you pose in their
photobooths to announce your support of open data and the Libraries.
One booth will be in
[Lehman](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/lehman.html) all week. The
other one will be roaming around the other SESSL Libraries,
[Burke](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html), and
[Butler](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html). Both will be at
Butler in on Thursday evening during the [Night @
Butler](https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&guid=CAL-00bb9e25-68a32c67-0168-a4614696-00000965events@columbia.edu&recurrenceId=) event, from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.

### Love Data Kisses

Finally, there are chocolate kisses floating around this week from the
Libraries and from the open data community. Find them and enjoy them, either
by sharing them with loved ones or keeping them all to yourself. Or something
in between.
