## Corpus-DB: A Corpus-Generation Framework for Computational Text Analysis

Corpus-DB is a textual corpus infrastructure for the digital humanities. It solves perennial problems of text aggregation, cleaning, and categorization that constitute so much of the labor of a text analysis project. Come learn to use Corpus-DB for your project in digital analysis, digital history, or computational social science, or come to learn more about the Corpus-DB project, and how to contribute.
