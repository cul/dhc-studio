A new year brings a new semester, which also means new events at Studio Butler in addition to our established programming. 

## Research Open Labs

Our popular Open Lab hours will begin receiving students, faculty, and professional staff beginning on Friday, February 1, 3–5pm, and will continue throughout the semester at the same timeslot. The Open Lab is a space for working groups and research collectives to meet and work on digital scholarship in the humanities and humanistic social sciences. Members of our library team will be at hand to support your work and answer any questions.

## Publishing Open Labs

Beginning this semester, we will offer a new Open Lab series focused on academic publishing. The Publishing Open Labs will take place this semester *each Monday from 3PM to 5PM*, beginning on *Monday, February 4*. Our Digital Publishing Librarian, Michelle Wilson, will lead the series and make herself available to answer questions, coordinate working groups and projects, and run mini-workshops around academic publishing. Stay tuned for an announcement soon! 

## NYC-DH Week Offerings

In collaboration with Studio Lehman, we are planning a series of exciting offerings at Columbia University Libraries in celebration of New York City Digital Humanities Week, *February 4-8*. To learn more visit our detailed [NYC-DH Columbia schedule](). 

## Mini Course: Mapping bibliographies

This Spring we are planning a 4 part mini-course on the geographical representation of bibliographical data. If you were ever interested in mapping a list of citations or your own research notes, this is the mini-course for you. In this course you will be learning advanced uses of Zotero, how to clean data with GoogleRefine and how to import and publish a web map using Carto.

- Monday, March 25, 1-3PM: Entering and Exporting Data with Zotero
- Monday, April 1, 1-3PM: Cleaning Data with OpenRefine
- Monday, April 8, 1-3PM: Introduction to Carto
- Monday, April 15, 1-3PM: Publishing Your Webmap

## Speaker Series

Stay tuned for an announcement later in the semester about our guest speakers. This year we hope to bring some exciting voices in cultural analytics, experimental and mobilized humanities, social justice and more.

## Course Labs

One of the most popular uses of the Studio is the Course Lab—a digital laboratory attached to a seminar. The goal of these laboratory is usually to work on digital projects in lieu of or as a compliment to writing assignments. Over the past five years the Studio has been the home for more than a dozen of these labs. This semester we are honored to welcome Pamela Smith, Dennis Tenen, and the Center for Spatial Research and their digital laboratories. If you are thinking of including a digital pedagogy component to your course, don't hesitate to contact our Digital Scholarship Librarian, Alex Gil <agil@columbia.edu>.

## Graduate Student Working Groups

Students working on digital humanities projects are welcome to reserve the space for regular, scheduled use. This year we welcome a team Musicology working on the MUSICONIS project under the direction of Susan Boynton. If you would like to reserve regular use of the space for collaborative, non-profit scholarly work, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Creative Use of the Butler Studio

The Butler Studio continues to be open for imaginative scholarly work in need of a co-working space. In the past we have held research sprints—four or eight hour marathons of collaborative work—that seek to either answer a research question or build a scholarly resource. These include Wikithons, collective bibliographies and pre-dissertation peer-research.

In addition to our *researchathons*, the space has been used for digital art installations, peer-to-peer workshops, on-demand workshops, rapid prototyping, mobilized humanities efforts, and more. Have an idea for an event? Reach out to us.
