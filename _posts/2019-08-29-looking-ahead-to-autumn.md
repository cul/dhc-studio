The [librarians]({{ "/people.html" | relative_url}}) at the Columbia
University Libraries Studio invite you to join us for a packed Autumn of Open
Labs, workshops, and talks.

### Get in Touch

First, to keep up to date with the Studio, follow the [`#CULStudio`
hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23culstudio&src=typed_query) on Twitter
or either the Libraries’ [`@ColumbiaDS` (Digtial
Scholarship)](https://twitter.com/columbiads?lang=en) or [`@ColumbiaLibData`
(Research Data Services)](https://twitter.com/columbialibdata) Twitter
accounts.

To keep up to date with Studio events via email, please [subscribe to our
e-mail list](https://lists.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/studioatbutler).

### Open Labs

As always, the Friday [Open Lab]({{ "/open-lab.html" | relative_url }}) at
[Studio at Butler]({{ "/spaces/butler/" | relative_url }}) will take place
3–5pm in Butler 208B. The first Friday Open Lab is September 13th.

Last year, we introduced Open Labs at [Studio at Lehman]({{ "/spaces/lehman/"
| relative_url }}). Those return this year, Mondays through Thursdays, 12–4pm,
in Lehman 215.

Additionally, the Publishing Open Labs return this semester at Studio at
Butler. Stay tuned for more information about those.

### Workshops

We have two extended workshop sessions this semester, from librarians Alex Gil
and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira. 

Alex will lead a four-part session introducing users to Minimal Computing via
the Libraries-produced tool [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/):

* *Minimal Computing 1: Learn to Create Online Scholarly Archives with Wax*,
September 19, 2019, 1–3pm, [Studio at Butler]({{ "/spaces/butler/" |
relative_url }}). [RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e24-6c7042f7-016c-72cca1cb-00006a76events%40columbia.edu)

* *Minimal Computing 2: Learn to Create Online Scholarly Archives with Wax*,
October 3, 2019, 1–3pm, [Studio at Butler]({{ "/spaces/butler/" |
relative_url }}). [RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e28-6c704be3-016c-73bc541d-00003728events%40columbia.edu)

* *Minimal Computing 3: Learn to Create Online Scholarly Archives with Wax*,
October 10, 2019, 1–3pm, [Studio at Butler]({{ "/spaces/butler/" |
relative_url }}).  [RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e28-6c704be3-016c-73bf0b9f-0000372aevents%40columbia.edu)

* *Minimal Computing 4: Digital Narratives and Web Design*,
October 17, 2019, 1–3pm, [Studio at Butler]({{ "/spaces/butler/" |
relative_url }}).  [RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e28-6c704be3-016c-73c6c94e-000037a5events%40columbia.edu)

The goal of the series is to equip you to be an independent producer of
digital archives and exhibits related to your research, in a way that reduces
costs of maintenance, bandwidth, storage, access and more. In Alex’s workshop
series, you will learn how to create websites on your computer before
uploading them to the internet. In particular we will be spinning up a website
meant for housing a collection of images and essays.

Moacir, in the meantime, will lead a two-part workshop series called “PhD
Gitsertation,” which will show researchers (but particularly graduate
students) how they can use versioning software like Git to manage large-scale
research projects like dissertations or monographss:

* *PhD Gitsertation 1: Git + Dissertation*, October 2, 2019, 4–6pm,
[Studio at Lehman]({{ "/spaces/lehman" | relative_url }}).
[RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e28-6c6b24b7-016c-6d4bd9b9-000051a1events%40columbia.edu)

* *PhD Gitsertation 2: Writing with Git*, October 9, 2019, 4–6pm,
[Studio at Lehman]({{ "/spaces/lehman" | relative_url }}).
[RSVP](https://library.columbia.edu/about/events/event.html?guid=CAL-00bb9e28-6c6b24b7-016c-6d4bd9b9-000051a1events%40columbia.edu)

Please check the [Research Data Services
calendar](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/events.html)
for more workshops, including workshops on GIS and R.
