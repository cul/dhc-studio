A new year brings a new semester, which also means new events at [Studio at
Butler]({{ site.baseurl }}/spaces/butler). This semester, we will continue to
offer an [Open Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab) every Friday, 3â€“5pm.

Additionally, Studio at Butler is introducing Open Labs on Mondays, as well,
beginning February 4. Facilitated by Digital Publishing Librarian Michelle
Wilson and Assistant Director of Scholarly Communication and Projects Nicky
Agate, these Open Labs will be focused on academic publishing and scholarly
communication.

In late March, Digital Scholarship Librarian Alex Gil and
GIS/Metadata Librarian Eric Glass will be leading a four-part mini-course on
the geographical representation of bibliographical data. Stay tuned for a more
in-depth description of the four sessions in the upcoming weeks.

Finally, we hope to finalize our guest speaker schedule and make an
announcement soon about bringing some exciting voices in cultural analytics,
experimental and mobilized humanities, social justice, and more.
