This course lab, led by Terry Catapano and Prof. Pamela Smith, will introduce humanities and social science graduate students to the skills and issues involved in working with texts in a digital environment. The course lab will equip students with a variety of skills that will be employed in creating a small scale digital edition of an anonymous sixteenth-century manuscript compilation of technical recipes.  No prior experience in digital techniques necessary. The course was designed to overlap with [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) open Lab hours to encourage collaboration and cross-disciplinary encounters in the domain of digital humanities.
